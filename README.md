# Single file version

I made a basic tutorial where you can see how to make a
vim or nvim file like this, check the link
[here](https://andresmpa.github.io/nvim-configuration/)

This was my first implementation, I moved to
[Core version](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration/tree/vimscript)
when the init.vim file was too long, then I moved to
[Lua version](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration)
when I discovered Lua, instead of that I used this
config for almost a year and I worked perfectly so
If you don't want/need to keep updating things, fixing bugs,
searching for information about vim or you just want to
edit things on a server this configuration is more than
enough for you.

If this information match to you, check this version
[prerequisites](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration#prerequisites)
also see the [quick start](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration#quick-start)
to install its minimal version

### As a plus

> I've written this [Cheat sheet](https://github.com/andresmpa/nvim-configuration/blob/main/cheatsheet.md)
> for those that don't know too much about Vim just like me when I

## For those who are starting

This version is quite simple an it's divied on "slides", each "slide" contains
a piece of information that vim/nvim uses to make what we tell it to do, check
the [init.vim](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration/blob/singleFile/init.vim)
file and look for the those lines with 3 double quotes, those are the headers
of the "slides", also this can be a template if you're stating on nvim, but I
also made other two versions of this project that are a little more complicated:

- [Core version](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration/tree/vimscript)
- [Lua version](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration)

I'd like to share a couple of tools to make me a better developer, check those
[tools](https://github.com/AndresMpa/nvim-configuration/tree/main#apps)
could be a good idea
